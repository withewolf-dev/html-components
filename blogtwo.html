          The side effects of useffect Before functional programming got popular
          with hooks , we had class components. Functional programming with
          hooks makes code clean, readable and reusable and the industry never
          looked back. As much as I love functional components , I miss the
          lifecyle methods the class components used to provide.<br /><br />
          Two of the most used lifecycle methods of class components are
          componentWillUpdate, is called just before rendering.
          componentDidUpdate ,is called just after rendering. <br /><br />The
          methods were clear and you would use whatever suits your needs <br />.
          Now , if you run the below code you will see the console log in the
          chrome console <br /><br />
          <img class="container container-center" src="image/ssone.png" />
          <br />

          What if we didnâ€™t want to show the console log on the first
          initialization of the app but after initialization we want to show the
          log on every render. With class components it would have been pretty
          straightforward using the suited method, but not with functional
          components. Therefore we have a lill hack. Run the below code .
          <br /><br />
          <img class="container container-center" src="image/sstwo.png" />
          <br />

          We know that even with dependencies useffect runs on first
          initialization. What we did here is that we created a state init with
          default state true, when the app runs for the first time, inside the
          useffect it will check if the init is true or false. On the app
          initialization the init is default to true it will set init state to
          false. Now on every re render it will check init and will skip it as
          the init now is false and will go to the else condition
