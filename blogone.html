          Flutter is one of the most divopular framework to build mobile
          application. I never thought to give it a try because I was in total
          love with react and js. Getting introduced to react and js was
          probably one of the life changing instance for me.I tried react native
          and really loved the fact how I can reuse my reactjs knowledge here.
          As I never had any previous mobile development experience I believed
          nothing can get better than this. After few months flutter 2 was
          released and I thought to give it a try. The last time I was excited
          to use a framework was nextjs, good documentation does that to you.
          Flutter has one of the best documentation, flutter has specific
          documentation for react native developers, native developers and web
          developers. This makes it easy to understand flutter using knowledge
          of previous skills. Countering one of the popular belief, developers
          don’t want to try flutter because they will need to learn dart. I got
          comfortable with dart in just 3 days and it holds true for lot of devs
          with decent js skills. After setting up flutter I was mind blown by
          the extensive tooling they provide with their plugins. This lowers the
          entry barrier and you can just start building to learn about flutter.
          One of the best feature for me is when I make an error, the ide
          highlights it and shows a link to the dart documentation to read about
          what went wrong and how to fix it. Building with flutter is fast,
          really fast, they provide a lot of inbuilt widgets to build your ui,
          you can’t say the same about react native, here you would have to go
          and search for some external ui lib like native base. Again countering
          the popular belief as it is not based on js we will miss out the
          extensive amazing libraries. We will not have any problem finding out
          libraries as there are lots of libraries to choose from. This are some
          of the few reasons why I love flutter
